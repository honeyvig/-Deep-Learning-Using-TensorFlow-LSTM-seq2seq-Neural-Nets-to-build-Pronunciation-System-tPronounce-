# -Deep-Learning-Using-TensorFlow-LSTM-seq2seq-Neural-Nets-to-build-Pronunciation-System-tPronounce
Building a Pronunciation System (tPronounce) using a TensorFlow LSTM-based seq2seq (sequence-to-sequence) model is a complex but exciting task. The goal is to design a model that takes a sequence of phonetic symbols or letters as input (representing the word) and predicts the correct pronunciation, potentially outputting a sequence of phonemes (speech sounds).

To create this system using a Seq2Seq LSTM-based architecture in TensorFlow, we will cover the following steps:

    Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset to train the model, which involves converting words into phonetic sequences (e.g., using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) for pronunciation).
    Model Building: Create an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model for generating the correct pronunciation.
    Model Training: Train the model on the prepared dataset.
    Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the pronunciation of new words.

Step 1: Data Preprocessing

For a pronunciation system, the first step is to prepare data where each word is mapped to its phonetic transcription. A simple example could be a word-to-phoneme dictionary like this:
Word	Phoneme Transcription
"hello"	/h ə l oʊ/
"cat"	/k æ t/
"apple"	/ˈæ p l/

For this, we will use the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation to represent the phonemes.

You can obtain datasets of words and phonemes (e.g., CMU Pronouncing Dictionary or LibriSpeech dataset) to train this model. For simplicity, here’s a basic example:

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Example word-to-phoneme mappings (usually you would use a much larger dataset)
word_to_phoneme = {
    "hello": "h ə l oʊ",
    "cat": "k æ t",
    "apple": "æ p l"
}

# Create a list of words and their corresponding phoneme sequences
words = list(word_to_phoneme.keys())
phonemes = list(word_to_phoneme.values())

# Create dictionaries to map characters to indices and vice versa
vocab = sorted(set(' '.join(phonemes)))  # Vocabulary of all phonetic symbols
word_vocab = sorted(set(''.join(words)))  # Vocabulary of all letters in words

char_to_index = {char: idx + 1 for idx, char in enumerate(vocab)}  # 1-based index for characters
char_to_index['<pad>'] = 0  # padding symbol

word_to_index = {word: idx + 1 for idx, word in enumerate(word_vocab)}  # 1-based index for words
word_to_index['<pad>'] = 0  # padding symbol

index_to_char = {idx: char for char, idx in char_to_index.items()}
index_to_word = {idx: word for word, idx in word_to_index.items()}

In this example:

    word_to_phoneme is a dictionary mapping words to their phonetic transcription.
    We create vocabularies for the phoneme symbols and letters in words, along with corresponding indices for use in the neural network.

Step 2: Model Building (Seq2Seq with LSTMs)

We will use a Seq2Seq (sequence-to-sequence) architecture with LSTM layers. The Seq2Seq model consists of an Encoder and a Decoder. The Encoder processes the input word sequence (letters) and encodes it into a context vector, while the Decoder generates the corresponding phoneme sequence.

Let’s implement this model using TensorFlow/Keras.

from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, Embedding

# Hyperparameters
latent_dim = 256  # Dimensionality of the latent space
max_input_len = max(len(word) for word in words)  # Maximum length of input word
max_output_len = max(len(phoneme.split()) for phoneme in phonemes)  # Maximum length of phoneme sequence

# Define the Encoder
encoder_inputs = Input(shape=(max_input_len,))
encoder_embedding = Embedding(input_dim=len(word_to_index), output_dim=latent_dim)(encoder_inputs)
encoder_lstm = LSTM(latent_dim, return_state=True)
encoder_outputs, state_h, state_c = encoder_lstm(encoder_embedding)
encoder_states = [state_h, state_c]

# Define the Decoder
decoder_inputs = Input(shape=(max_output_len,))
decoder_embedding = Embedding(input_dim=len(char_to_index), output_dim=latent_dim)(decoder_inputs)
decoder_lstm = LSTM(latent_dim, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
decoder_outputs, _, _ = decoder_lstm(decoder_embedding, initial_state=encoder_states)
decoder_dense = Dense(len(char_to_index), activation='softmax')
decoder_outputs = decoder_dense(decoder_outputs)

# Build the Seq2Seq Model
model = Model([encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs], decoder_outputs)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()

Explanation:

    Encoder: Takes the word (letters) as input, processes it through an LSTM layer, and outputs a context vector (hidden and cell states).
    Decoder: Takes the phoneme sequence as input (shifted by one time step), processes it through an LSTM, and generates the predicted phoneme sequence.
    The embedding layers convert the input and output sequences (words and phonemes) into dense vectors that can be processed by the LSTM layers.
    The Dense layer at the output uses a softmax activation to predict the next phoneme (from the phoneme vocabulary).

Step 3: Data Preparation for Training

Before training, we need to preprocess the data to format the inputs and outputs appropriately for the model.

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Convert words and phonemes to integer sequences
encoder_input_data = [[word_to_index[char] for char in word] for word in words]
decoder_input_data = [[char_to_index[phoneme] for phoneme in phoneme.split()] for phoneme in phonemes]
decoder_target_data = [[char_to_index[phoneme] for phoneme in phoneme.split()[1:]] + [char_to_index['<pad>']] for phoneme in phonemes]

# Pad sequences to the same length
encoder_input_data = pad_sequences(encoder_input_data, maxlen=max_input_len, padding='post')
decoder_input_data = pad_sequences(decoder_input_data, maxlen=max_output_len, padding='post')
decoder_target_data = pad_sequences(decoder_target_data, maxlen=max_output_len, padding='post')

# One-hot encode decoder target data
decoder_target_data = np.expand_dims(decoder_target_data, -1)
decoder_target_data = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(decoder_target_data, num_classes=len(char_to_index))

    Encoder Input Data: Converts the words into integer sequences based on the word_to_index mapping.
    Decoder Input Data: Converts the phonemes into integer sequences based on the char_to_index mapping.
    Decoder Target Data: The decoder target is the same as the phoneme sequence, but shifted by one time step.

Step 4: Model Training

Now that we have prepared the data and built the model, we can start training the model.

# Train the model
model.fit(
    [encoder_input_data, decoder_input_data],
    decoder_target_data,
    batch_size=32,
    epochs=100,
    validation_split=0.2
)

Step 5: Prediction

Once the model is trained, we can use it to predict the pronunciation of new words.

# Function to decode the output sequence
def decode_sequence(input_seq):
    # Encode the input word to get the encoder's state
    states_value = model.predict(input_seq)

    # Create an empty target sequence of length 1
    target_seq = np.zeros((1, 1))
    target_seq[0, 0] = char_to_index['<pad>']  # Start with padding token

    # Initialize the decoded sentence
    decoded_sentence = ""

    # Repeat for each step in the output sequence
    for _ in range(max_output_len):
        output_tokens = model.predict([input_seq, target_seq])

        # Get the predicted phoneme (argmax)
        sampled_token_index = np.argmax(output_tokens[0, -1, :])
        sampled_char = index_to_char[sampled_token_index]

        # Append the predicted phoneme to the sentence
        decoded_sentence += " " + sampled_char

        # Exit loop if the model predicts the end-of-sequence token
        if sampled_char == "<pad>":
            break

        # Update the target sequence to the predicted phoneme
        target_seq[0, 0] = sampled_token_index

    return decoded_sentence.strip()

# Example: Predict the pronunciation of a new word
new_word = "apple"
input_seq = pad_sequences([[word_to_index[char] for char in new_word]], maxlen=max_input_len, padding='post')
predicted_pronunciation = decode_sequence(input_seq)
print(f"Predicted pronunciation for '{new_word}': {predicted_pronunciation}")

Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered how to build a pronunciation system (tPronounce) using an LSTM-based seq2seq model with TensorFlow. The model is trained to predict the correct phonetic transcription of a given word based on its letters.

This setup is a basic framework. In a production system, you would typically need a larger dataset, possibly pre-trained word embeddings, and additional refinements for better accuracy.
